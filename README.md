# Hello! I'm Arit! 👋🏾

### As a 38-year-old mum of 2 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, I pivoted from a public health background into Software Engineering. 👩🏽‍💻

I attended the [Firehose Project](https://thefirehoseproject.com/) coding bootcamp. I landed my first engineering job 6 months after graduating.

I run a community of software developers & other techies: [**The Arit Developer Circle**](https://www.arit.dev/circle).

I speak at conferences, seminars, workshops & podcasts. 🎙️ 

Thanks for reading! 💛
