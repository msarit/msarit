# Hello! I'm Arit! 👋🏾

### As a 38-year-old mum of 2 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, I transitioned from a public health background into Software Engineering. 👩🏽‍💻

I attended the [Firehose Project](https://thefirehoseproject.com/) coding bootcamp. I landed my first engineering job 6 months after graduating. I share that story on my [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc5AyncB_Xw). 📺

I currently work at [**Forem**](https://www.forem.com/), where we're building the next generation of ultra-customizable, data-respecting, privacy-obsessed online community software! I LOVE MY JOB. I adore my teammates. Do consider [contributing to our codebase](https://github.com/forem/forem)! 🌱

Fueled by my passions for teaching and empowering others, I'm an instructor at [**Coding with Arit, Developer**](https://coding.arit.dev), and I founded [**Our Time For Tech**](https://ourtimefortech.org/): a nonprofit program for women seeking to break into Tech.

I speak at conferences, seminars, workshops & podcasts. 🎙️ 

Thanks for reading! 💛
