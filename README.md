# Hello! I'm Arit! 👋🏾

### As a 38-year-old mum of 2 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, I pivoted from a public health background into Software Engineering. 👩🏽‍💻

I attended the [Firehose Project](https://thefirehoseproject.com/) coding bootcamp. I landed my first engineering job 6 months after graduating. I share that story on my [**website**](https://www.arit.dev/story). 📺

Fueled by my passions for teaching and empowering others, I founded [**Our Time For Tech**](https://ourtimefortech.org/): a nonprofit organization that supports women starting Tech careers.

I also run a community of software developers: [**The Arit Developer Circle**](https://www.arit.dev/circle).

I speak at conferences, seminars, workshops & podcasts. 🎙️ 

Thanks for reading! 💛
