# Hello! I'm Arit! 👋🏾

### As a mom of 2 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦  in her late thirties ⏳, I transitioned from a public health background into Software Engineering. 👩🏽‍💻

I attended the [Firehose Project](https://thefirehoseproject.com/) coding bootcamp. I landed my first engineering job 6 months after graduating. I share that story on my [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc5AyncB_Xw). 📺

I work at [**Forem**](https://www.forem.com/), an open source initiative that is building the next generation of ultra-customizable, data-respecting, privacy-obsessed online community software! I LOVE MY JOB. I adore my teammates. Please consider [contributing to our codebase](https://github.com/forem/forem)! 🌱

Motivated by how much I've been supported as an early-career dev, I founded [**Our Time For Tech**](https://ourtimefortech.org/), a nonprofit program for women seeking to break into Tech.
We have two cohort types:
 - *CodeCollab* - mentees build a complex, forward-facing application utilizing Agile principles, and emerge with an impressive addition to their portfolios.
 - *BetterPrep* - mentees are kept super-accountable to their job search goals, practice algorithms and learn to ace whiteboarding through mock interviewing.

I blog at [**Arit.dev**](https://arit.dev). ✍🏾

I speak at conferences, workshops & podcasts. 🎙️ 

I am raising two *incredible* children, who humble and amaze me every day. 😍

**I am truly blessed!** 🙏🏾 Thanks for reading! 💛
